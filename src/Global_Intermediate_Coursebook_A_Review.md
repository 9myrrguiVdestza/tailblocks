The coursebook consists of 12 units that cover topics such as culture, media, technology, travel, art, and business. Each unit has four main sections: Language and Culture, Global English, Global Voices, and Global Issues. The Language and Culture section introduces the main vocabulary and grammar points of the unit, as well as some cultural information. The Global English section provides extra reading practice with texts written by David Crystal, a world-renowned expert on the English language. The Global Voices section gives students the opportunity to listen to authentic native and non-native speakers in their own time, furthering their learning. The Global Issues section explores a controversial or current topic related to the unit theme, encouraging critical thinking and discussion.
 
The coursebook also comes with an eBook (a PDF version of the coursebook with embedded audio tracks) and an access code for the Studentâs Resource Centre, where students can download course audio, videos and worksheets[^2^]. The eBook offers students a page-faithful version of the print coursebook with interactive audio. The Studentâs Resource Centre provides additional practice and support for students.
 
The coursebook is designed to help students develop their communicative competence and prepare them for academic or professional situations. It also exposes them to a variety of accents and registers of English, as well as different perspectives and opinions on global issues. The coursebook is suitable for intermediate level students who want to improve their English skills and broaden their horizons.
  
The coursebook is accompanied by a Workbook (With Answer Key) that provides further opportunities to revisit and consolidate the vocabulary, structures and skills students have already encountered in each unit. The Workbook also includes a Progress check at the end of every unit and a full Optimise Practice test based on the Cambridge for Schools exam at the end of the book[^2^]. The Workbook is available with or without a CD that contains additional listening exercises.
 
The coursebook is also supported by a Teacher's Book Premium Pack that includes the Teacher's Book and access to the Teacher's Resource Centre, Presentation Kit, Test Generator and all the digital student components. The Teacher's Book contains detailed teaching notes, tips on how to teach exam students, work with mixed-ability classes and extra teaching notes to further support students in their exam skills. The Teacher's Book also includes a range of specialist methodology essays written by award winning ELT authors[^2^]. The Teacher's Resource Centre provides downloadable worksheets, tests, audio and video materials. The Presentation Kit is an interactive whiteboard software that allows teachers to present and interact with the coursebook content in class. The Test Generator is a tool that enables teachers to create and customize tests for their students.
 
Global Intermediate Coursebook is a well-designed and engaging coursebook that offers students a rich and varied learning experience. It is ideal for intermediate level students who want to develop their language skills and learn more about the world around them.
